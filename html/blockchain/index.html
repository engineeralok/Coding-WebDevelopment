    <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a distributed ledger with <del>growing</del> running lists of records (blocks)
        that are securely
        linked together via <mark>cryptographic</mark> hashes. <sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a
        cryptographic hash of the previous
        block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
        represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since
        each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list
        data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions
        are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
        without altering all subsequent blocks.

        <ins>Blockchains</ins> are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public
        distributed
        ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction
        blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be
        considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]

    <p>A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
        to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by
        Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it
        the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or
        central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by
        the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.[7]

        Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized
        blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[8] however, others have argued that permissioned
        blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than
        permissionless ones.[4][9]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems
        Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work on a cryptographically
        secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to
        implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
        Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document
        certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
        hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[13]

            <br>
        The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto
        in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks
        without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the
        rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a
        core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the
        network.[3]
        <br><br>
        In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on
        the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from
        January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had
        exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[15]
        <br><br>
        The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
        popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[16]
        <br><br>
        According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained
        a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[17]
        Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of
        Digital Commerce.
        <br><br>
        In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
        organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with
        blockchain".[18] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a
        'game-changer' for their business.[19]

    <h2>Structure and design</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[3][20] This allows the participants to verify
        and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[21] A blockchain database is managed
        autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
        collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[22] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where
        participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the
        characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was
        transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as
        a value-exchange protocol.[23] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail
        the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]

        Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[24]
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation[25] and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)
    </ul>

    <h3><b>Blocks</b></h3>

    <p>The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the
        time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the
        transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set
        to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[33]
    </p>

    <h3>Hard forks</h3>
    <i>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) ยง Hard fork.[edit]</i>
    <p>
        A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward-compatible and requires all users to
        upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits
        into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.

        For example, Ethereum was hard-forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by
        exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and
        Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a
        rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major
        cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after
        negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new
        software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[34]

        A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin Cash.[35] The
        network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate for
        demand.[36]
